# An interesting website

<p>A website I'm personally a fan of is called Qwiklabs - find it at https://www.qwiklabs.com.</p>
<p>It's a site where you can get official certifications and such on Google's cloud platform (free if you're a student). Obviously, Google might have a vested interest in promoting this since it means more people have proficiency in this platform over, say, Azure or AWS - however, unfortunately for Microsoft and Amazon, neither of them have as intuitive or user-friendly tutorials as Google does through Qwiklabs.</p>
<p>The lessons are broken into bite sized chunks, and all of them are based around projects and such rather than just lectures or note-taking. For every individual lesson part, you're given a full-scale instance of the Google Cloud Platform, and guided through doing various tasks in a huge variety of different subject matters. No matter what you want to do, if there's a connection to cloud computing in there, Qwiklabs covers it. All in all, it's an invaluable tool for a student looking to get a few new skills under their belt.</p>
